It sends a notification to us who will contact your primary doctor and the surgeon to let them know if youâ€™ve been following the regiment post-op.
2.	The company needs it because it allows the surgeon and the primary doctor to be in communication as to what is going on with every patient. The medical history is fully disclosed to us and we are expanding this to most countries around the world. If something were to happen to you in a country that you are visiting, then they will be able to see the fully disclosed medical history, which can only be viewed by a doctor
